*Random forest regression is a powerful machine-learning algorithm that analyzes complex datasets and accurately predicts continuous values.  This predictive model can provide invaluable insights to guide businesses in decision-making.  In this project, various predictive models are created and compared to guide a fictitious ski resort in setting the ideal ticket price to maximize profits.*

# Method

1. **Project proposal:**  Suggested plan for research methods and objectives

2. **Data wrangling:**  Found, imported, cleaned, and transformed data to prepare for analysis

3. **Exploratory data analysis:**  Examined the dataset to find patterns and insights and created graphics to visualize the data

4. **Develop machine learning algorithms:**  Created, evaluated, compared, fine-tuned, and improved models to determine which was best in this context

5. **Modeling:**  Used the chosen model to predict which business decisions will best serve the company and maximize profit
   
6. **Conclusions and recommendations:**  Examined the results and recommended future business actions

 &nbsp;   
***Final model:   Random Forest Regression***
     
The algorithm that performed best for determining what ticket price is best for the resort was a random forest regression model.  One of the reasons for choosing this model is that the random forest regression had a smaller mean absolute error than using the mean or the linear regression model.  The random forest model also provided more detailed business insights, such as which features of the resort had the largest impact on business outcomes.

# 1. Background
[Problem identification](./01_problem_identification.pdf)

Big Mountain Resort offers access to 105 trails and spectacular views of Glacier National Park and Flathead National Forest and hosts about 350,000 visitors each year. The resort has remarkable facilities, including a newly installed additional chair lift.  

Using data from the resort and its competitors, we can identify opportunities for the resort to make the most of its current facilities, set the best possible ticket prices, ensure that new investments pay off, and plan for the most profitable future.

### About the data:
The dataset used for this project is for practice purposes and is at least partly fictional data.  The data provided in Springboard curriculum was contained in a single CSV file that contained information about 330 resorts. 

#### Demographics
* ID: Customer's unique identifier    
* Year_Birth: Customer's birth year    
* Education: Customer's education level
