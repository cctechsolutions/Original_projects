*Companies who understand their customers and their behavior have an advantage over their competitors.  These understandings help companies know what messages will resonate with them and how to attract and retain these customers.  Insights into customers and purchase behavior can also help companies know how to attract certain types of customers and increase certain types of purchase behavior.  As of 2022, e-commerce accounts for nearly 19% of all purchases, and this is expected to continue increasing over the next few years.[^1]  Our client, a grocery store chain, wants to use these types of insights to increase online purchases from their customers.*

# Method

1. **Project proposal:**  Suggested plan for research methods and objectives

2. **Data wrangling:**  Found, imported, cleaned, and transformed data to prepare for analysis

3. **Exploratory data analysis:**  Examined the dataset to find patterns and insights and created graphics to visualize the data

4. **Develop machine learning algorithms:**  Created, evaluated, compared, fine-tuned, and improved models to determine which was best in this context

5. **Modeling:**  Used the chosen model to predict which business decisions will best serve the company and maximize profit
   
6. **Conclusions and recommendations:**  Examined the results and recommended future business actions

 &nbsp;   
***Final model:   Random Forest Regression***
     
The algorithm that performed best for determining what ticket price is best for the resort was a random forest regression model.  One of the reasons for choosing this model is that the random forest regression had a smaller mean absolute error than using the mean or the linear regression model.  The random forest model also provided more detailed business insights, such as which features of the resort had the largest impact on business outcomes.

#### About the data:
The dataset used for this project is for practice purposes and is at least partly fictional data.  The data provided in Springboard curriculum was contained in a single CSV file that contained information about 330 resorts.
