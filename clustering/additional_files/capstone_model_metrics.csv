About the choice of algorithm:,,,About the choice of metric:,,,,,
"I chose the algorithm that performed best by silhouette score that also created clusters of useful sizes.  For these purposes, we did not need evenly-sized clusters, but clusters that had only a handful of customers or less would not be much help for understanding customer base or making business decisions.  KMeans is also a fast, efficient, and easily interpretable algorithm that works well with multi-dimensional datasets, like this one.  Therefore, KMeans was an ideal option for this project.",,,"I considered other common metrics used for clusterin g algorithms.  Many, such as Rand index and mutual information are extrinsic measures, which means that they require true labels (clusters) as they compare our model's performance to real outcomes.  This is not an option for this project.  There are other intrinsic measures, metrics that, like silhouette score, do not require knowledge of ""true"" labels.  Calinski-Harabasz is similar to silhouette score, while Davies-Bouldin focuses more on similarity rather than distinction.  One disadvantage of all these intrinsic measures is that they work best for models that are distance based, like KMeans, and are not as useful for density-based clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and Optics.  This may be something to consider in future research, as it is possible that I discounted one or more of these density-based models due to poor performance as indicated by silhouette score.  In future research, I may examine additional or alternative metrics, particularly for DBSCAN and Optics.",,,,,
